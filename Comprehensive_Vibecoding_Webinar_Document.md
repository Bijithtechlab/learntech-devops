### Core Content: What is Vibe Coding? (10 minutes)

**Defining the Revolution**
"Vibe coding isn't just a buzzword - it's a fundamental shift in how we approach software development. Let me explain what makes it revolutionary:

**Traditional Coding Challenges:**
- Steep learning curves requiring months or years of study
- Complex syntax memorization across multiple languages
- Time-consuming debugging processes
- Repetitive boilerplate code writing
- Difficulty translating creative ideas into functional code
- High barrier to entry for career changers and beginners

**The Vibe Coding Approach:**
Instead of getting bogged down in technical complexity, vibe coding focuses on:

1. **Natural Language Programming**: You describe what you want in conversational English, and AI generates the corresponding code instantly
2. **Context-Aware Development**: AI understands your entire project context, suggesting relevant solutions and improvements
3. **Effortless Code Generation**: Transform business ideas into working applications without traditional coding barriers
4. **Intelligent Problem Solving**: Focus on logic and creativity while AI handles syntax and implementation details

Think of it as having a senior developer sitting next to you, understanding your vision, and helping you build it instantly. You become the architect while AI handles the construction."

**Real-World Impact Examples:**
- Sarah, a marketing professional, built her startup's MVP in 2 weeks using vibe coding techniques

### Interactive Q&A Session (10 minutes)

**Comprehensive FAQ Responses:**

**Q: Do I need any prior coding experience or technical background?**
A: Absolutely not! This course is specifically designed for complete beginners. We start from fundamental concepts and build up using AI assistance. In fact, sometimes having no prior experience is advantageous because you won't have to unlearn traditional, time-consuming coding practices. Our most successful graduates often come from non-technical backgrounds.

**Q: Will I actually learn to code, or am I just becoming dependent on AI tools?**
A: You'll learn fundamental programming concepts, logic, and architecture, but through a modern, efficient lens. Think of it like learning to drive with GPS versus memorizing every street. You understand navigation principles and can adapt to any route, but you're not wasting time on outdated methods. You'll understand what the AI is doing and can guide it effectively.

**Q: What if I get stuck during the course or need additional support?**
A: We provide comprehensive support including:
- Live mentoring sessions twice weekly
- Peer learning groups and study partnerships
- 24/7 access to course materials and recorded sessions
- Direct instructor access via dedicated Slack channels
- One-on-one consultation sessions for complex challenges
- Extended support for 30 days post-course completion

**Q: How is this different from traditional coding bootcamps or computer science degrees?**
A: Traditional programs focus on syntax memorization and theoretical concepts. We focus on practical problem-solving and leveraging modern AI tools - skills that will remain relevant as technology evolves. While others spend months learning syntax, you'll be building real applications from day one.

**Q: What kind of computer or setup do I need for the course?**
A: Any modern laptop (Windows, Mac, or Linux) with internet connection is sufficient. We'll help you set up all necessary tools during the first session. No expensive software or hardware required - most tools we use are free or have generous free tiers.

**Q: Can I balance this course with my current job or studies?**
A: Yes! The evening schedule (6:30-8:30 PM IST) is designed for working professionals and students. The intensive format means you'll see rapid progress, maintaining motivation throughout the program.

**Q: What happens after course completion? Do you provide job placement assistance?**
A: We offer comprehensive career support including:
